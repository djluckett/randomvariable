Description: This package allows for defining arbitrary random variable object 
    from a probability density function or cumulative distribution function. 
    Users can extract surivival functions, hazard functions, and 
    moment-generating functions from a random variable object, as well as 
    calculating probabilities, summarizing distributions, and generating 
    random variates.
